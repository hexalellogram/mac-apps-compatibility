# Mac Apps Compatibility - macOS 13.0 Big Sur

Note that most, if not all, compatibility assessments are my own.
I do not take legal responsibility for any of these assessments of compatibility, nor do I guarantee that my assessments are accurate.
My usage may not be the same as your usage, and so I may have missed certain items that you may notice.
These applications' developers may have more updated information on this subject than me.

## Homebrew

- [x] Homebrew - works ~~but developer tools need to be installed beforehand from the Apple Developer More Downloads page instead of through `xcode-select --install`~~ As of developer beta 2, the install script at brew.sh now works. The `xcode-select --install` command is still slow if run manually, but I canâ€™t tell if that is just slow or actually not working.
