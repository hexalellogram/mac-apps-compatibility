# Mac Apps Compatibility - macOS 10.15 Catalina

Note that most, if not all, compatibility assessments are my own.
I do not take legal responsibility for any of these assesments of compatibility, nor do I guarantee that my assessments are accurate.
My usage may not be the same as your usage, and so I may have missed certain items that you may notice.
These applications' developers may have more updated information on this subject than me.
